With funding from the Shuttleworth Foundation and support from Mozilla, Liberate Science seeks to provide an alternative to traditional scientific publishing through the collective power of open science.

As the founding designer, I lead the team in the creation of beautiful and accessible user interfaces and user experiences for both desktop and web.

Initially, we were developed [[Hypergraph]], a desktop application to facilitate peer-to-peer scientific research sharing and tracking built upon the Hypercore Protocol (now [Holepunch](https://docs.holepunch.to/)).

Informed by UX research insights, we pivoted to creating [[ResearchEquals]], a centralized web-app for"as-you-go" instead of "after-the-fact" research sharing.
