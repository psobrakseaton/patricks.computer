My name's Patrick Sobrak-Seaton. I am a product designer from the [[California Bay Area]], but [[Berlin]] based since 2017.

Currently I am helping [[UP42]] change the way we see the world through Earth observation data and analytics. Previously I was at [[Liberate Science]] looking to provide an alternative to traditional scientific publishing through the collective power of open science.
